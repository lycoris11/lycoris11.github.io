Growing up, I always idolized FAANG companies â€” the seemingly untouchable giants of tech. Discovering a bug in Amazonâ€™s code and having the opportunity to contribute a fix was a humbling reminder that even the best have room for improvement.

This experience underscored a simple truth: Nobody is perfect, not even the industry leaders we admire. But more importantly, it reinforced the idea that our responsibility as developers goes beyond just writing flawless code.

We must support each other, scrutinize systems, and notify maintainers when we spot something off. Letâ€™s aim to contribute wherever we can, even if weâ€™re not being paid to do so. Itâ€™s about being part of a community that helps everyone thrive.

Tech is a collaborative journey, and by lending a hand, providing insights, and sharing discoveries, we foster an environment where everyone benefits. Hereâ€™s to continuous learning, mutual respect, and the small yet significant contributions that help keep our digital world spinning smoothly. ðŸš€

## Update
They reached out to me, confirmed it was indeed a bug, thanked me, and then told me that they would patch it themselves in the upcoming release.
